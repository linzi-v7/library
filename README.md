# Library  

## Overview  

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum, focusing on creating a simple library application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can add new books, view a list of all books, remove books, and toggle the read status of each book. The app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project prioritizes functionality and interactivity over visual design.

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML5** â€“ Structures the content of the application.  
- **CSS3** â€“ Handles styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Implements the logic for adding, displaying, removing, and toggling the read status of books.  

## Features  

- **Add a New Book**: Users can add a new book by filling out a form with details such as the book's title, author, number of pages, and whether it has been read.  
- **Display Books**: The app displays all books in the library in a grid of cards, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate.  
- **Remove a Book**: Each book displayed has a button to remove it from the library.  
- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can toggle the read status of a book (e.g., from "Read" to "Not Read Yet" and vice versa) with a button on each book's display.  

## Project Structure  

The project is organized into the following key components:  
  
- **Book Form**: A form that allows users to input book details (title, author, pages, and read status).  
- **Library Display**: A grid of cards that displays all books in the library. Each card includes:  
  - Book title, author, and page count.  
  - A button to toggle the read status.  
  - A button to remove the book from the library.  

## Future Enhancements  

- **Local Storage**: Save the library data to local storage so that it persists after the page is refreshed.  
- **Search and Filter**: Add functionality to search and filter books by title, author, or read status.  
- **Enhanced Styling** â€“ Adding **CSS animations and transitions** for better UX.  
- **Edit Book Details**: Allow users to edit the details of a book after it has been added.
- **Sorting Books**: Users can sort books alphabetically, by author, or by page count.
- **Clean Code**: Refactor the code to follow best practices and improve maintainability.
